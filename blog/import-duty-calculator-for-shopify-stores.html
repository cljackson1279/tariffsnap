            <div class="container article-content">
                <p>If you run a Shopify store and source products from overseas, you've likely encountered the complexities of import duties and tariffs. Miscalculating these costs can turn a profitable product into a money-losing venture overnight. This guide will walk you through how to use an import duty calculator for your Shopify store, understand landed costs, and ensure every product you sell is profitable.</p>

                <h2>What Are Import Tariffs and Why Do They Matter for Shopify Stores?</h2>
                <p>Import tariffs (or duties) are taxes collected by a country's customs authorities on goods imported from another country. For Shopify store owners in the US, this means that products sourced from countries like China, Mexico, or India are subject to additional taxes upon arrival. These taxes can range from 10% to over 50% of the product's value, significantly impacting your profit margins.</p>
                <p>Understanding your true landed cost—the total cost of a product by the time it reaches your warehouse—is crucial. The landed cost includes the product cost, shipping, insurance, and, most importantly, import duties. Without an accurate landed cost, you can't set a profitable retail price.</p>

                <h3>The Problem with Shopify's Built-in Tools</h3>
                <p>While Shopify offers some tools for calculating duties at checkout for international customers, it doesn't provide a simple way for store owners to calculate their own import costs when sourcing products. This leaves many sellers guessing, often leading to costly mistakes. That's where a dedicated Shopify tariff calculator comes in.</p>

                <h2>Step-by-Step: Using TariffSnap as Your Shopify Import Duty Calculator</h2>
                <p>TariffSnap is designed to be the simplest and fastest import duty calculator for Shopify stores. Here’s how to get a complete tariff audit in under two minutes:</p>

                <h3>Step 1: Export Your Products from Shopify</h3>
                <p>First, you need a CSV file of your products. In your Shopify admin, go to "Products" and click "Export." You can choose to export all products or just a selection. We recommend starting with your top 50 best-sellers to get a quick overview of your tariff exposure.</p>

                <h3>Step 2: Upload Your CSV to TariffSnap</h3>
                <p>Navigate to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lbOdmatdx0Gg20ttcc-32qgsOBwYUSt8tE8H6HkCFBs/viewform" target="_blank">TariffSnap upload form</a> and upload the CSV file you just exported from Shopify. Our system will automatically read your product data.</p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <p>💡 Make sure your CSV includes columns for product cost (FOB), country of origin, and product category. This information is essential for accurate tariff calculations.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Step 3: Receive Your Complete Tariff Audit</h3>
                <p>After uploading your CSV and completing the $59 payment, you'll receive a detailed tariff audit in your email inbox within two minutes. This report is more than just a calculation; it's an actionable plan for your Shopify store.</p>

                <p>Your personalized report will provide a clear breakdown of your tariff costs and actionable recommendations:</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for Shopify Sellers</h2>

                <h3>How do I find the HS codes for my products?</h3>
                <p>Harmonized System (HS) codes are international standards for classifying products. You can find them using the <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/tata/hts/index.htm" target="_blank">US International Trade Commission's HTS search tool</a>. However, for most e-commerce products, a general category (e.g., "electronics," "textiles") is sufficient for an accurate estimate with TariffSnap.</p>

                <h3>Can I add tariff costs to my product prices in Shopify?</h3>
                <p>Yes, and you should! Once you know your true landed cost, you can adjust your retail prices in Shopify to ensure you maintain a healthy profit margin. Some Shopify apps, like Magical Product Fees, can also help you add surcharges at checkout.</p>

                <h3>What's the difference between a tariff and a duty?</h3>
                <p>The terms are often used interchangeably. A tariff is a tax on imported goods, while a duty is the amount of tax owed. For practical purposes, they refer to the same cost you need to pay.</p>

                <h3>How often do tariff rates change?</h3>
                <p>Tariff rates can change due to trade policies and international agreements. For example, US tariffs on Chinese goods have changed significantly in recent years. TariffSnap stays up-to-date with the latest rates, so you don't have to.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion: Take Control of Your Shopify Margins</h2>
                <p>Don't let hidden tariff costs eat away at your profits. Using an import duty calculator for your Shopify store is no longer optional—it's a necessity for any serious e-commerce business. With a clear understanding of your landed costs, you can make smarter sourcing decisions, price your products profitably, and scale your Shopify store with confidence.</p>
