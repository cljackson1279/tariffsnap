            <div class="container article-content">
                <p>This case study explores how a Shopify store in the home goods niche was able to save over $6,000 per month by conducting a simple tariff audit. It highlights the hidden costs of import tariffs and the power of data-driven decision-making in e-commerce.</p>

                <h2>The Challenge: Shrinking Margins and Unknown Costs</h2>
                <p>The store, which we'll call "Modern Home Decor," was experiencing a common problem: despite growing sales, their profit margins were shrinking. They sourced the majority of their products from China and were aware of the tariffs, but they hadn't quantified the exact impact on each SKU. They were flying blind, and it was costing them dearly.</p>

                <h2>The Solution: A Comprehensive Tariff Audit with TariffSnap</h2>
                <p>Modern Home Decor decided to use TariffSnap to get a clear picture of their tariff costs. They exported a CSV of their top 50 SKUs from Shopify and uploaded it to the TariffSnap platform. Within minutes, they received a detailed report that changed the course of their business.</p>

                <h3>The Findings: Shocking Revelations</h3>
                <p>The TariffSnap report revealed several critical insights:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>12 Money-Losing SKUs:</strong> Nearly a quarter of their top products were being sold at a loss due to the 30% tariff on Chinese goods.</li>
                    <li><strong>$6,200 in Monthly Losses:</strong> The 12 money-losing SKUs were collectively costing the business over $6,000 per month in net losses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inaccurate Pricing:</strong> Many of their products were underpriced because the landed cost did not accurately reflect the tariff costs.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <p>💡 The report provided a clear "KEEP / KILL / CHANGE PRICE" recommendation for each SKU, allowing the store owner to take immediate, decisive action.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>The Action Plan: From Data to Decisions</h2>
                <p>Armed with this new data, Modern Home Decor implemented a three-pronged action plan:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Discontinue Money-Losing SKUs:</strong> They immediately discontinued the 12 products that were losing them money. This single action stopped the $6,200 monthly loss.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reprice Profitable Products:</strong> They adjusted the prices of their profitable products to reflect the true landed cost, improving their margins on every sale.</li>
                    <li><strong>Explore New Sourcing Options:</strong> They began to explore sourcing from Mexico and Vietnam for new products to take advantage of lower tariff rates.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>The Results: A More Profitable and Resilient Business</h2>
                <p>The results of the tariff audit were transformative:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>$6,200+ in Monthly Savings:</strong> By eliminating the money-losing SKUs, they immediately added over $6,000 to their monthly bottom line.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improved Profit Margins:</strong> By repricing their products, they improved their overall gross margin by 8%.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data-Driven Confidence:</strong> They were able to make strategic decisions about their product catalog and sourcing with confidence, knowing they had a clear understanding of their true costs.</li>
                </ul>
